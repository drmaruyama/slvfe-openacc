ERmod (Energy Representation Module) is a program to calculate the solvation free energy based on the energy representation method. The program allows users to calculate the solvation free energy in arbitrary solvent, including inhomogeneous systems, and runs in cooperation with state-of-art molecular simulation softwares, such as NAMD, GROMACS, and AMBER.

## Requirements
- NVIDIA HPC SDK (https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk)

## Typical Installation
This package is built with autotools. To compile the program,
1. configure the package with "configure",
2. then compile the package with "make".

Current configuration script only supports nvfortran compiler.
